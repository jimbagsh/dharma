Learning English through Buddhism in Mongolia

Fields like medicine and business have their own specialized English terminology, and so does the dharma. So, to increase access to dharma teachings written or taught in English, a dharma student needs to learn more about this specialized branch of the English language.

## About
Dharma.Anglihel.com is part of a family of websites created to help students improve their English, especially in Mongolia, but all are welcome. Those familiar with the material at Anglihel.com will feel at home here. Dharma.Anglihel.com uses the same format to help improve your dharma English using audio, video, and translation-definitions. If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact me through our Anglihel.com Facebook page.

## Content
The site consists of three texts:

1. English-Mongolian Buddhist Glossary
2. Prince Siddhartha: The Story of Buddha
3. Preserving Mongolian Culture - Buddhism

As with other Anglihel.com sites, definitions, translations, audio and video will be used to help the learner better understand dharma English.

## Our Goal
To help all dharma students improve their English fluency, especially so they could understand better the dharma teachings written in English or taught in English, by using online books, translation glossaries and basic dharma information, and all taking advantage of mulitmedia technologies.

## About Me
My name is Jim and I am a certified ESL teacher with almost a decade of experience teaching English, mostly to adults living in Mongolia. I have created the Anglihel.com family of websites (Anglihel.com, Medical.Anglihel.com and Dharma.Anglihel.com) with the sole purpose to help improve the English fluency of students in Mongolia (but all are welcome). As of this writing, I have not found any advisors to help me with Dharma.Anglihel.com but I will continue to look.
